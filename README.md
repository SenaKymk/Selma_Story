# Selma Story — EN→TR Click-Translate

A tiny single-file webpage (HTML+JS+CSS) where **every word in the story is clickable**.  
When you click a word, a bubble pops up in the **top-right** showing its **Turkish meaning** for **5 seconds**.  
Fully offline, mobile-friendly, and uses a fixed background image.
